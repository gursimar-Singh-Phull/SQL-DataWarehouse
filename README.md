Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Showcase

Welcome to the Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Showcase! 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete, real-world data warehousing and analytics pipeline—from raw data ingestion to delivering business insights. It’s designed to highlight practical, industry-aligned skills in data engineering and analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture

This solution follows a layered architecture inspired by the Medallion Model:

Bronze Layer – Raw Intake

Unprocessed data (CSV, JSON, APIs) is ingested directly into the staging area.

Silver Layer – Refinement

Data is cleaned, standardized, validated, and enriched to ensure analytical readiness.

Gold Layer – Business Layer

Star-schema models and curated datasets optimized for reporting, dashboards, and decision-making.

📖 Project Overview
Data Engineering

Build a modern data warehouse using SQL Server and Python.

Consolidate multiple sources into a unified analytical environment.

ETL Pipelines

Implement extract–transform–load workflows.

Automate ingestion and transformation processes across the Medallion layers.

Data Modeling

Design fact and dimension tables.

Optimize schema structures for fast analytical queries.

Analytics & Reporting

Write SQL-based insights on sales, customers, and product performance.

Support data-driven decisions with dashboards and reports.
